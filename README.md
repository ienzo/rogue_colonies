# rogue_colonies
A mod for Stellaris that adds rogue colonies

3 main kinds of Rogue Colonies 
  1. Mid-game crisis rogue colony
  2. One planet minors that aren't necessarily crises and should be normal empires
  3. Refugee empires spawning out of specific circumstances

# Characteristics of the Ascendancy Rogue Empire Colony
 Will have superior tech and Fallen Empire Surplus Ships
 Will found their capital on a random planet
 look at distar.3014 & distar.3016 (Nivlac) and syndaw.1022

# One planet minors
One planet minors are nations made from rogue colonists who aren't overpowered like the Ascendancy. Their habitable_planet did not pop out of nowhere like the Ascendancy.
Grant them all habitablity technologies. They'll need it lol. It cannot be researched from debris anyhow. The +5  habitablities and the tomb world habitablity. Could there be a check to prevent spawning on tomb worlds?
  - There's a chance that the rogue colony will still spawn in a world they cannot inhabit. Sucks to be them lol
  - Copy tech and copy survey from home.
  - Can happen to AI
  - Still retains the negative opinion from the homeworld as these are renegade colonists
